## Insights Derived from the Data:

### City Official Map
This map shows the Jersey City start and end stations. The more blue a marker is, the more popular it is as a start station, and the larger the marker, the more popular it is as an end station. From the markers, it is clear that the same popular start stations are popular end stations as well. This data is layered over income data based on zip code, and it can be concluded that the popularity of a bike station is not dependentent on the income of the area. The most popular station is in the wealthiest area, but the second most popular station is in a different, less wealthy zipcode. The only similarity is the location on a main street, making it more easily accessible. 

### First Phenomenon - Age is Just a Number
This dashboard shows visualizations related to the length of a biking trip, in terms of distance and time, based on age of biker. Although younger bikers, around the 18-20 age, make up majority of the minutes biked, when it comes to distance, they are similar to bikers in their 70s. This can show that younger bikers use them more recreationally, while older bikers use them more purposefully.  

### Second Phenomenon - Who's Biking? A Biker Profile. 
This dashboard shows who the current bikers are. Majority of the current bikers are male, an average age of 37, and use the bikes mostly on the weekdays. This can show that the bikes are used mainly for work purposes, explaining the increase of use on the weekdays.
